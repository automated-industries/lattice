// `src/gui/app/script.ts` (a single 7319-line template literal) was split into
// per-subsystem segments under `src/gui/app/modules/`, composed back into `appJs`
// in the original order via `modules/index.ts`. The split is a pure source-
// organization refactor: the composed string MUST equal the original byte-for-byte,
// which is what proves the inlined `<script>${appJs}</script>` is unchanged.
//
// These constants pin the composed `appJs`. They are re-captured whenever `appJs`
// changes intentionally (the modules are edited together as the source of truth):
// the offline-retry self-heal, the 3.4.1 merge's workspace-switch logo refresh
// (the switch path now re-fetches /api/dbconfig + re-points the header logo,
// matching the boot path), the manual-upgrade link (the version chip's
// "Update available — Upgrade" affordance: checkUpdateAvailable + wireUpdateLink,
// wired at boot and refreshed on each reconnect version check), and the FOUC fix
// that softens the two background in-place re-renders (advanced-mode toggle +
// workspace-switch reload now pass {soft:true} so they never paint the loading
// frame), and the 4.2 structured-source-importer GUI, reachable only by dropping a
// JSON/xlsx file into the assistant chat: the upload returns a proposal and an
// inline confirm card renders into the assistant rail (no top-bar button, no
// modal), and the 4.4 inline-HTML-file feature: the file preview renders an
// `artifact_type='html'` file live in a sandboxed `srcdoc` frame (with an injected
// CSP + the bundled chart library decoded from a window global), plus the bundled
// minified Chart.js itself (assigned to `window.__LATTICE_CHART_LIB__`), which is
// the bulk of the size jump. Recapture the length + hash on any intended change.
